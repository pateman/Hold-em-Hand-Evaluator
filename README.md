# Hold'em Hand Evaluator

This project's aim was to develop a handy module which could be used to determine an outcome of a Texas Hold'em poker game. In its current state it's pretty much finished, but is *likely* to contain bugs, so before you use it in your own project, make sure to thoroughly test it beforehand, because I'm pretty sure that there may be some specific hands for which the evaluator will either return with a wrong outcome or the resulting top cards will not be correct.

### Usage

Have a look at `pl.pateman.holdemevaluator.evaluator.HoldemEvaluatorTest` to learn how to use the evaluator. You can build the project using Gradle.
